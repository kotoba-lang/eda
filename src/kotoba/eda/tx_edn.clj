  Datomic/Datascript tx-data vector produced by edn-datomize.bb
  (`[{:db/id -1 <ns>/<key> <value-or-pr-str-blob> ...}]`), returning the
  flat map either way.

  docs/oss_manifest.edn and docs/sample_flow.edn already use idiomatic
  per-key namespaces (:eda.oss/*, :eda.job/*, :eda.flow/*, ...), so
  edn-datomize.bb ran in namespace-preserving mode for them: attribute
  keys are kept exactly as-is (not re-prefixed), only :db/id was added and
  non-scalar values (nested maps / vectors-of-maps) were pr-str'd into
  string \"blob\" attributes. `reconstitute`/`slurp-tx-edn` undo exactly
  that: strip :db/id and read any blob string back into live data, so
  downstream key lookups (:eda.oss/reports, :eda.flow/jobs, ...) keep
  working unchanged."
